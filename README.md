# Game 1 idea: Space Shark

# Overview
Space Shark is a thrilling side scroller combining two of my favorite things: Sharks and Aliens! This game is about a shark that is chasing after aliens in pursuit of catching his favorite snack, a human, that was abducted right out of the ocean before his very eyes as he was about to feast. The game begins with a shark launching out of the water into space to find his meal, eating the aliens along the way all while avoiding asteroids. While ridiculous in theory, the point of the game is to be both engaging and humorous for users.

- Day 1 (second half): Get basic player movement down with JS using Canvas and test
- Day 2 (first half): Get computer player movement down with JS using Canvas and test
- Day 2 (second half): Get background animation moving and begin designing advanced player and computer characters
- Day 3 (first half): Implement enhanced design of player and computer characters in the live game and test
- Day 3 (second half): Start enhancing the game map
- Day 4 (first half): Implement game music and test
